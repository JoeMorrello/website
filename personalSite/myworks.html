					<h2>Arduino Controlled Cannon</h2>
						<p id= 'cannontext'>We were tasked with developing a safe, controllable cannon that can interest children in the STEM fields at a very young age.  We developed a cannon that was controllable from a distance via a control box that had added safety parameters so that no child would be in danger. Within the group, I collaborated with the design of the project, keeping in mind our parameters of safety, and a visible representation of basic physics. We used two Arduino Megas for the project, one that would be used on the cannon to regulate angular movement and pressure, and another that would be sending the appropriate commands for increasing and decreasing the movement and pressure, and for the final launch. My personal contribution was developing the communications between the Arduinos so that no bits were dropped as they communicated in serial, and to make sure this implementation would keep steady communication.</p>
	                <h2>QBert in Assembly</h2>
	                	<p>In 2016, as a school project, we were asked to develop a game using Assembly code. With a single partner, we went on to develop Qbert on our processor, utilizing several hardware features and systems.  The game relied on an ASCII interface that was communicated across the processor to your screen, over a serial connection. Additionally, the basic controls were implemented in the keyboard for the user, but features such as pausing were handled by buttons embedded in the processor. Additionally, for the display, we used the LEDs that were on the board to show the user how many lives they had, and if the game was currently in session. I collaborated with my partner in developing the control handling, score implementation and all LED setup and usage.</p>
	                <h2>Android Map Tracker</h2>
	                	<p>I oversaw and created an android Application utilizing the Google Maps and Location API to track a userâ€™s movement and relay statistics back to the user We Utilized source control (Git) to collaborate and work with teammates on developing features and functionality. Personally, I implemented location functionality, tracking functionality, and major GUI components.</p>
